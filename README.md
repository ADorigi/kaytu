## Overview


- **Ease of use**: One-line command. Use without modifying workloads or making configuration changes.
- **Optimize**: Optimize AWS EC2 Instances & AWS RDS Instances/Clusters.
- **Base on actual Usage**: Analyzes the past seven days of usage from Cloud native monitoring (CloudWatch).
- **Customize**: Optimize for region, CPU, memory, network performance, storage, licenses, and more to match your specific requirements.
- **Secure** - no credentials to share; extracts required metrics from the client side
- **Open philosophy** Use without fear of lock-in. The CLI is open-sourced, and the Server side will be open-sourced soon.
- **Coming Soon**: Non-Interactive mode, GCP, Azure, GPU Optimization and Observability data from Prometheus

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Kaytu CLI

**MacOS**
```shell
brew tap kaytu-io/cli-tap && brew install kaytu
```

**Linux**
```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaytu-io/kaytu/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (and all Binaries)**
Download Windows (Linux, and MacOS) binary from [releases](https://github.com/kaytu-io/kaytu/releases) 


### 2. Login to AWS CLI

Kaytu works with your existing AWS CLI profile (read-only access required) to gather metrics.  

To confirm your AWS CLI login is working correctly:

```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```
[Click here to see how to log in to AWS CLI.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/command-line-sign-in.html)

We respect your privacy. Our open-source code guarantees that we never collect sensitive information like AWS credentials, IPs, tags, etc.

### 3. Run Kaytu CLI

```shell
kaytu
```

This will run and install any plugins.

To see how you can optimize EC2 Instances, run this command:

```shell
kaytu optimize ec2-instance
```

Some optimizations such as RDS require login: 
```shell
kaytu login
```

For RDS:

```shell
kaytu optimize rds-instance
```
